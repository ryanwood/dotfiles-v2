Ryan's dotfiles
===================

Roughly based on [thoughtbot dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles)

Install
-------

Clone the dotfiles:

    git clone git://github.com/ryanwood/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm):

    brew tap thoughtbot/formulae
    brew install rcm

Install the dotfiles:

    env RCRC=$HOME/dotfiles/rcrc rcup

This command will create symlinks for config files in your home directory.
Setting the `RCRC` environment variable tells `rcup` to use standard
configuration options:

* Exclude the `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `Brewfile` files, which are part of
  the `dotfiles` repository but do not need to be symlinked in.
* Give precedence to personal overrides which by default are placed in
  `~/dotfiles-local`

You can safely run `rcup` multiple times to update:

    rcup
